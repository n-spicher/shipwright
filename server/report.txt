QUESTION 1:
What geologic formation underlies the project site, and how is it generally described?

ANSWER:
The project site is underlain by carbonate bedrock, which weathers differentially to produce a very irregular top of rock profile.  The residual soils present can generally be excavated with conventional earth-moving equipment, but hard bedrock or large boulders will require hoe-ram chipping or blasting for removal.

QUESTION 3:
How can construction activities such as blasting impact the development of solutioning features like sinkholes?

ANSWER:
Normal blasting to remove hard rock can create micro-fractures in the bedrock.  These micro-fractures allow greater surface water infiltration into areas that may not normally receive water, potentially disturbing old solutioning features and/or creating new ones.  These features can develop during and/or after construction, causing construction delays and unexpected repair costs.

QUESTION 4:
What specific recommendations are made to reduce the risk of future sinkhole development during and after construction?

ANSWER:
To reduce the risk of future sinkhole development, the following measures are recommended:

*   Wells should not be constructed on the site.
*   Positive slopes should be maintained away from building and pavement areas during and after construction.
*   All downspout drains should be contained in pipes and routed to discharge points far from buildings into stormwater management (SWM) areas.
*   New deep utilities should not be located within building areas if possible, and new utility trenches along building perimeters should be located outside the influence zone of new foundations.
*   Positive slopes should be maintained around footing excavations and the building footprint before and after concrete placement.
*   SWM ponds and/or bio-retention filters should be lined with a synthetic geomembrane to arrest infiltration and reduce sinkhole risk.  If cost-prohibitive, a minimum 12-inch thick layer of low-permeability clay (permeability no more than 1x10-6 cm/sec) can be used, though this will not eliminate the risk.

QUESTION 5:
What was discovered during the field exploration in terms of subsurface conditions, including the presence of groundwater and bedrock?

ANSWER:
Field exploration revealed that most borings encountered woodland cover (0.5-6 inches thick), except boring B-101 which had 2 inches of asphalt and 6 inches of stone.  Fill, classified as tan-brown high plasticity clay with a medium stiff consistency (SPT N-value of 5 blows per foot), was found in boring B-101 to a depth of approximately 2 feet below existing grade.  Below the surface material and/or fill, residual soil was present to the planned termination depths or auger refusal on hard rock.  This residual soil generally consisted of red-brown and tan-brown fat clay with varying amounts of sand and rock fragments; silt was found in borings B-108, B-117, B-125, and B-131; and weathered, decomposed limestone was encountered in borings B-105 and B-106 at a depth of 5 feet below existing grades.  SPT N-values in the residuum ranged from 2 to >50 blows per foot, indicating soft to very dense consistency.  Hard rock was encountered in most borings at depths ranging from 1 to 19.3 feet below existing grades, with many borings encountering rock at depths less than 10 feet.  Rock coring revealed hard to very hard gray limestone with recovery percentages of 77-100% and RQD values of 18-87 (mostly 40-50).  Groundwater was found in borings B-107 (18 feet) and B-121 (15 feet) below existing grades; however, water levels were not checked after coring in those borings.  Fluctuations in perched water and groundwater levels may occur due to environmental conditions, surface drainage, and other factors.

QUESTION 10:
What standby power operation and energy-saving features are included in the elevator operation system?

ANSWER:
On activation of standby power, the elevator car returns to a designated floor, parks with doors open, and can be manually put back into service via switches at the fire command station.  Manual operation overrides automatic operation.  When the elevator load exceeds 80% of rated capacity, the doors begin closing. When the elevator is stopped, unoccupied, and the doors are closed, lighting, ventilation fan, and cab displays de-energize after 5 minutes and re-energize before the doors open.

QUESTION 17:
What are the acceptable installation methods and support requirements for suspended lighting luminaires?

ANSWER:
Suspended lighting luminaire installation must comply with NECA 1.  Luminaires should be installed level, plumb, and square with ceilings and walls unless otherwise noted.  Supports must be sized and rated for the luminaire's weight and capable of maintaining position after cleaning and relamping without causing ceiling or wall deflection.  Mounting devices must support a horizontal force of 100% and a vertical force of 400% of the luminaire's weight.

Specific methods depend on the type of suspended luminaire:

* **Pendants and Rods:** If longer than 48 inches, bracing is needed to limit swinging.
* **Stem-Mounted, Single-Unit Luminaires:**  These should be suspended with twin-stem hangers, supported by an approved outlet box and accessories that hold the stem and damp oscillations. The outlet box must be vertically supported to the building structure using approved devices.
* **Continuous Rows of Luminaires:** Use tubing or stem for wiring at one point and tubing or rod for suspension for each unit length of the luminaire chassis, including one at each end.
* **Ceiling grid support is prohibited for pendant luminaires.** Support wires or rods must connect to the building structure.

QUESTION 19:
What are the identification requirements for electrical system components and connections in this section?

ANSWER:
Section 260553, "Identification for Electrical Systems," details the requirements.  It specifies color-coding for phase identification (e.g., black for Phase A, red for Phase B, blue for Phase C in 208Y/120V circuits), legends indicating voltage and system type, warning labels (including OSHA regulations), and equipment identification labels (black letters on a white field).  Additionally, it outlines requirements for labels (vinyl wraparound, self-adhesive), tapes (marker, self-adhesive vinyl, floor marking, underground line warning), tags (metal), and signs (baked enamel, laminated acrylic or melamine plastic).  The section also mandates the use of consistent designations throughout the project and coordination with project drawings, manufacturer's wiring diagrams, and operation and maintenance manuals.  Finally,  identification must be installed before concealing elements like acoustical ceilings.
